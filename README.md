# Hi, I'm Mehraj Hossain
## AI Architect & Product Engineer

I am an AI Architect specializing in rapid R&D and AI-native development. I don't just write code; I design and orchestrate complex, multi-modal AI systems.

My core strength is translating a product vision into a full-scale, functional application. I leverage generative AI as a force multiplier to build, debug, and deploy sophisticated systems at a fraction of the time of traditional development. This allows me to focus on what matters: the product logic, the user experience, and the architectural integrity.

## 🚀 Flagship Projects

These are not just code; they are full-scale, architected AI products.

### 1. Advanced Virtual Try-On Application
I transformed a basic tech demo into a market-ready product. The most significant feature is an advanced computer vision pipeline that can take **any** real-world photo (e.g., from a website or social media), automatically identify and segment the clothing, clean the image, and add it to a user's persistent, personal wardrobe.

* **Architecture:** React front-end, Google Cloud Run backend, multiple AI models for segmentation, in-painting, and virtual try-on.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Advanced Wardrobe Pipeline:** Extracts clothing from any user-uploaded image.
    * **Persistent Gallery:** Saves generated outfits to a user-specific database.
    * **Prompt-Based Editing:** Allows users to refine generated images (e.g., "change lighting," "change pose") via chat.
    * **Multi-Model Support:** Easily switch between user and clothing models.


*(A live demo is available. I am happy to provide a live walkthrough.)*

### 2. Multi-Modal AI Assistant
This is a fully integrated "ChatGPT-like" assistant that orchestrates multiple, distinct AI services into a single, cohesive chat interface.

* **Architecture:** A containerized web application that manages the state and logic between text, image, and analysis models.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Orchestrates 4+ AI Services:** Seamlessly integrates:
        1.  **Text Generation** (Google Gemini)
        2.  **Image Generation**
        3.  **Conversational Image Editing**
        4.  **File Analysis (RAG):** Upload a document and "talk" to it.
    * **Complex State Management:** Maintains a unified conversation context across different modes (e.g., editing an image that was generated three messages prior).

*(This project is deployed as a scale-to-zero serverless microservice. Please contact me for a live demo.)*
